TCP Server
This is a simple TCP server written in C++ that listens for incoming connections, accepts clients, and echoes back any messages received from the clients.

Prerequisites
Before running the server, ensure that you have the following:

Windows operating system
C++ compiler with support for Winsock (e.g., MinGW, Visual Studio)
Basic understanding of TCP/IP networking
How to Use
Compile the Code: Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler. Make sure to link against the Winsock library (ws2_32.lib).

Example with MinGW:

Copy code
g++ server.cpp -o server.exe -lws2_32
Run the Server: Execute the compiled executable to start the server.

bash
Copy code
./server.exe
Connect Clients: Clients can connect to the server using a TCP/IP client program (e.g., Telnet, PuTTY).

Interact with Clients: Once a client is connected, the server will echo back any messages received from the client.

Terminate the Server: To terminate the server, press Ctrl + C or close the terminal window.

Important Notes
This server listens on port 54000 by default. You can change the port by modifying the hint.sin_port value in the code.
Make sure to handle errors and exceptions appropriately, especially when dealing with socket operations.
Ensure that the Winsock library is correctly linked during compilation to avoid linker errors.
